        Commitment to quality means no frozen or processed ingredients and no
        pre-chopped produce. During peak hours, it could mean a little more
        waiting time, yet as many satisfied customers would readily attest, it's
        worth every minute of it.

        <h3>Ababa Sacco & The Staff</h3>
        <p>
          Ababa Steak Restaurant, has been serving authentic american style
          steak for almost 1 decade. Chef Ababa began his delicious career in
          culinary school in America. He furthered his skill at hotels and
          restaurant in Isle of Man, London and Frankfurt. Here, to keep it
          fresh, each dish is prepared when you order, to maintain the freshness
          of even the scantiest of ingredients.
        </p>

    <p class="content-text">
      Yet, from years of experience, Chef Ababa knows that a great meal alone is
      not enough to put the restaurant on the map like it is today. It requires
      the best ambiance in the kitchen and throughout the restaurant. He is, of
      course, referring to the women and men who help him serve the best Italian
      food in Bali. “I know it’s a cliché to say that, but we’re all one big
      family here. I speak Indonesian, so there isn’t any communication problem,
      and most of the times we all feel like we’re happily sharing a home”, he
      says. The smiling staff around the restaurant is a testament to that. You
      will immediately feel this family atmosphere every time you visit ABABA
      Steak Restaurant.
